//  TODO: Take a single song object and represent it as HTML on the DOM
//  1. define a song object
//  2. convert song to HTML representation
//  3. get reference to DOM element in which to put HTML representation
//  4. insert HTML representation into DOM element using innerHTML




//  TODO: Take a an array of song objects and represent them as HTML on the DOM
//  1. define an array of song objects
//  2. iterate array of song objects and convert each song to HTML representation
//  3. get reference to DOM element in which to put HTML representation
//  4. insert HTML representation into DOM element using innerHTML




// find DOM location to put all songs as HTML

// iterate songs

    // make HTML for each song
 
    // insert HTML into DOM location




// TODO: MODULARIZE THE ABOVE CODE AND CREATE FUNCTIONS FOR REPEATED SINGULAR TASKS - using exports and imports, and write functions that take arguments
// create files and/or functions with descriptive names like...
// 1. SongDataProvider
// 2. SongAsHTML
// 3. SongList

// ! ideally, main.js should only import and invoke the one function responsible for handling all of the functionality

// ? can you think of any other way to refactor the code following the single-responsibility principle??
